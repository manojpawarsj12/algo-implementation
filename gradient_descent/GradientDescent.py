# ## TODO: Implementing the basic functions
# Here is your turn to shine. Implement the following formulas, as explained in the text.
# - Sigmoid activation function
#
# $$\sigma(x) = \frac{1}{1+e^{-x}}$$
#
# - Output (prediction) formula
#
# $$\hat{y} = \sigma(w_1 x_1 + w_2 x_2 + b)$$
#
# - Error function
#
# $$Error(y, \hat{y}) = - y \log(\hat{y}) - (1-y) \log(1-\hat{y})$$
#
# - The function that updates the weights
#
# $$ w_i \longrightarrow w_i + \alpha (y - \hat{y}) x_i$$
#
# $$ b \longrightarrow b + \alpha (y - \hat{y})$$


# Implement the following functions

# Activation (sigmoid) function
def sigmoid(x):
    return (1/(1+np.exp(-x)))

# Output (prediction) formula


def output_formula(features, weights, bias):
    return sigmoid(np.dot(features, weights)+bias)

    bias += learnrate * d_error

# ## Training function
# This function will help us iterate the gradient descent algorithm through all the data, for a number of epochs. It will also plot the data, and some of the boundary lines obtained as we run the algorithm.

# When we run the function, we'll obtain the following:
# - 10 updates with the current training loss and accuracy
# - A plot of the data and some of the boundary lines obtained. The final one is in black. Notice how the lines get closer and closer to the best fit, as we go through more epochs.
# - A plot of the error function. Notice how it decreases as we go through more epochs.
